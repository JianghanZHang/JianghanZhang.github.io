Hi, I am Jianghan Zhang, a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu), [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu).

My current research interests focus on the intersection of optimal control, numerical optimization, and machine learning for robotics.

Over the last two years of my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) at the [Machines in Motion Lab](https://www.machinesinmotion.org), NYU, where I focused on optimal control of robotics. In the summer of 2023, I was fortunate work with [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) at the [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io), on an egocentric action prediction algorithm for human-robot interaction.
