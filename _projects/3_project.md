- Developing contact implicit trajectory optimization algorithms to enhance robotic interaction in complex environments, enabling dexterous manipulation and legged locomotion without pre-specified mode sequences
- Integrated the MuJoCo contact model into optimal control problems for direct trajectory planning, effectively generating a range of motion trajectories for a quadruped robot without pre-specified mode sequences.
- Exploring alternative contact models, including learned models, to enhance the performance and versatility of the algorithm for dexterous manipulation tasks.
